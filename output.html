    <h1>Information about the API</h1>
    <p>The API I selected displays a random cat fact</p>
    <p>the website that I got it from was the following link: <a href="https://apipheny.io/free-api/">Link</a></p>
    <p>It is the second API from the top</p>
    <p>Here are some quick applications of this API</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're really into cat facts and want to know a random fact every morning</li>
        <li>If you work as a felinologist and want to spread information about cats</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="results">
        <h1 style="margin-top:1mm">This is the result of the API request using AJAX</h1>
        <p id="ajax_str"></p>

        <h1 style="margin-top:1mm">This is the result of the API request using fetch</h1>
        <p id="fetch_str"></p>
